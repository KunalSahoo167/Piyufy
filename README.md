# Upcoming Major Update Feature includes :

Node.js with Express: This is a popular choice for backend development with JavaScript. You can set up APIs for managing user data, playlists, songs, and more.

Python with Flask/Django: If you're comfortable with Python, Flask (for lightweight apps) or Django (for full-featured apps) can be used to build the backend.

Database Integration: For storing data (like users, playlists, song metadata), you can use databases like:

MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexibility.

MySQL or PostgreSQL (SQL) for relational data.

Hosting: You can host the backend on platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS, while the frontend (your HTML, CSS, and JS) can stay on GitHub Pages or similar platforms
