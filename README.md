# Piyufy
Piyufy is a Spotify clone built by Sanchit &amp; Kunal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As our first project, we've focused on animations, features, &amp; backend technologies. We're continuously improving it as we learn, aiming to make it even better with each update!

3. Remove forward and backward nav buttons from the stickybar
4. add 3 new class in stickybar , 1: to hold Logo ; 2: to hold Home and Searchbar ; 3: to hold Sign up and Login in button
5. Add spotify logo without any text 
6. Add Home and Searchbar (with placeholder with less opacity : "What do you want to play?" ) in the stickybar
7. Remove profile icon from stickybar , replace Explore premium and Install app with Signup and Login in button
8. Add 2 new class inside footerinfo class , 1: to hold class = "f-info" and 2: to hold f-app class and adjust req CSS



Upcoming Major Update Feature includes :

Node.js with Express: This is a popular choice for backend development with JavaScript. You can set up APIs for managing user data, playlists, songs, and more.

Python with Flask/Django: If you're comfortable with Python, Flask (for lightweight apps) or Django (for full-featured apps) can be used to build the backend.

Database Integration: For storing data (like users, playlists, song metadata), you can use databases like:

MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexibility.
MySQL or PostgreSQL (SQL) for relational data.
Authentication: You can add user authentication features, like login and registration, using tools such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.

Hosting: You can host the backend on platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS, while the frontend (your HTML, CSS, and JS) can stay on GitHub Pages or similar platforms
